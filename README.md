# HTML5 Barebone Test Page

This is a HTML5 test page for [barebook's](https://barebook.io) User Interface (UI). This document is filled with common HTML elements, which is use for testing visual feedback , (especially typography) whilst building the style-guide.

In order to speed up things, this was build using Jekyll, we made use of Jekyll's collection to automatically include elements to the index page by looping into the elements collection's with liquid, and also auto generate the table of contents.

The HTML elements are categorized as **text**, **multimedia and embedding**, **tables** and **forms**

## Usage

### The Jekyll Version

If you have Jekyll installed, just open the folder in your editor (at code terminal) or the command line and run `jekyll serve`.

### The Static Version

The processed static version is in the `_site` folder, just open that folder and open the page/s in your browser.

If you want to role out your own style on the one that is not style (only html), please see `elements.html`. found in `_site` folder. You can easily copy/open that in your editor and start hacking your own base styles.

# HTML5 Barebone Test Page

This is a HTML5 test page for [barebook's](https://barebook.io) User Interface (UI). This document is filled with common HTML elements, which is use for testing visual feedback whilst building the style-guide.

In order to speed up things, this was build using Jekyll, we made use of Jekyll's collection to automatically include elements to the index page by looping into the elements collection's with liquid, and also auto generate the table of contents.

The HTML elements are categorized as **text**, **multimedia and embedding**, **tables** and **forms**

## Usage

You can use the Jekyll version, or see the `_site` folder for the processed static file
